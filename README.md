## P3 - Pseudo Population Parser
### What is this?

This is my 2018 summer side project.

P3 is a program that aids mvm popfile creators in avoiding simple errors such as invalid attributes, typo'd values, and general structure.

### Why Pseudo?

This isn't the actual parser that's used in the game.

P3 emulates it to a degree.

### How do I get it?
P3 is currently in development. If you would like to build the development build yourself, go ahead.

It will be fully released as a standalone executable when it is ready.

Or just ask me for the development build to test. (Not guaranteed featured or bug-free!)

### Connecting P3 to a text editor (Notepad++)
Save the following command as a Run.. command

`path\to\P3.exe -pop "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"`

Example:

`C:\Users\Simple\Desktop\P3\P3.exe -pop "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"`
